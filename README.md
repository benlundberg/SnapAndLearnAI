# 📸 Snap & Learn AI

**Snap & Learn AI** is a modern Android app built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Google AI Studio** that turns your camera into an instant learning tool.  
Take a photo of any text, and the app can **summarize**, **explain**, or **generate quizzes** — powered by on-device OCR (ML Kit) and AI.
